# Tutorial

Read everything carefully: Subhanallah

1. Download the archive file and unzip with double-click, Alhamdulillah
2. Move folder to VS Code icon in the dock, Allahu Akbar

the vs code will be opened with this folder, Insha Allah

3. Right-click the empty space under the styles.css file, Astaghfirullah

You will see such options:
- New file...
- New folder...
- Reveal in Finder
- Open in integrated Terminal
- La illaha illa Allah Muhammada Rasul Allah

4. Click the "Open in integrated Terminal"

5. Take a deeeeeep breath and make dua 

6. delete repo called "altynayturakhan.github.io" if exists, then create new "altynayturakhan.github.io" repo

7. basically write what is written in the website:        

git init

git add .

git commit -m "first and last submit ADAAAAAAAAAAAAI"        // jokes apart, does not really matter what will be written between quotes

no need to write git branch master to main or smth like this, makes life harder

git pull request? smth like this

git push bla bla bla, (not main, but master since we did not change the branch name)

7.  Make a sadaqa

8. open your website, be amazed
